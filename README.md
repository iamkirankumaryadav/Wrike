#### **Traits for efficient project management:**
1. All the `projects` need to be populated with tasks (Action Items)
2. The `title` should be in the form of a `verb` so that an assignee can understand the aim (Write the script, Create documentation, etc.)
3. All the tasks should be `assigned` (One assignee should be accountable for each task)
4. All the tasks should be `scheduled` (Prioritize your work daily)
5. Interconnect the tasks according to their dependencies, all the tasks are dedicated to a single goal (Gantt Chart View)
6. Mark the final step (Task) of your project as a `milestone` (Important event, Aim of the project)

### Providing Access to data:
1. Sharing (Share the space, folder or projects with team members, providing access and visibility)
2. Following (Follow up and keep an eye on the project, providing access and update)
3. Assigning (Complete responsibility for project tasks, providing accountability and responsibility)

### License Types:
1. Regular User (Have rights to view and edit)
2. External User (Have rights to only view, they can't edit, add new users or share it with anyone)
3. Collaborator (Limited rights within the workspace, change status, comment, and attach files)
